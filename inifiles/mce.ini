# Short [power] behaviour
#
# WARNING:
# Setting short, long, and double press to disabled will make it
# near impossible to turn off your device without removing the battery!
#
# Valid options:
# disabled - do nothing on short press
# poweroff - shutdown device
# softpoweroff - enter soft poweroff mode
# tklock-lock - lock touchscreen/keypad lock if not locked
# tklock-unlock - unlock the touchscreen/keypad lock if locked
# tklock-both - lock the touchscreen/keypad if not locked,
#               unlock the touchscreen/keypad lock if locked
